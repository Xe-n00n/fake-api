Guide to use:

Install dependencies first:

run 

```pip3 install fastapi uvicorn ```


run the app using
```python3 main.py```


(might be python.exe if you were on windows, not sure)

the app is meant to simulate what you will the original api is supposed to generate.
all you have to do is a get request to ```localhost:8000/data``` and arrange the data accordingly.

(test that the api works on your environment before you start integrating)
